My name, to you, is Casey Reardon. I am a computer science major. Most of what I’ve learned is in Java, often focusing on object-oriented programming. Outside of college, I took AP Computer Science in high school and a web design elective that only really covered very basic html and css Unfortunately, I do not have a lot of experience with css and javascript, but I’ve spent the last week working at it for this class.
I think a lot of the skills from this class are going to be useful in my future. Even outside of a web development context, being able to quickly adapt to and make use of new technologies is valuable. It also seems like this course covers quite a lot of information in general, some of which will surely be relevant to me at some point.
